# Neural Style Transfer

Neural style transfer is a collection of techniques that come out of deep learning that allow the style of one image
to be transfered to the content of another. The method was first introduced by [Leon Gatys et al.](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in 2016.

This repository contains various `tf.keras` implementations of style transfer algorithms.
