# Neural Style Transfer
Neural style transfer is a collection of techniques that come out of deep learning that allow the style of one image
to be transferred to the content of another. The method was first introduced by [Gatys et al.][1] in 2016.

This repository contains implementations of style transfer algorithms in TensorFlow 2.

## Prerequisites

The code in this repository relies on the following python packages, all of which can be installed via `pip`:

* `tensorflow`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* `click` (for command-line interface)
